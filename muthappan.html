            <h1>Muthappan</h1>
            <p>Muthappan is one of the most revered folk deities in the North Malabar region of Kerala, especially in Kannur and parts of Kasargod. His worship is deeply rooted in local traditions and the ritual art form of Theyyam. Unlike conventional Hindu gods confined to specific sects and traditions, Muthappan represents a unique blend of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, embodying characteristics of both Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu.</p>
            <p>What makes Muthappan's worship distinct is its inclusiveness. The deity is often portrayed in a dual form - part man, part dog - symbolizing his orthodox, yet compassionate nature. According to legend, Muthappan was born into a high caste Brahmin family but rejected orthodox practices in favor of a life devoted to helping the poor and marginalized. He roamed the countryside with his dog companions, accepting offerings of fish and toddy-items typically not used in traditional Hindu rituals-showing his acceptance of local customs and his connection with common people. </p>
            <p>Within this tradition, Thiruvappan is an equally significant figure- often understood as another form of manifestation of Muthappan. The worship of Muthappan is incomplete without acknowledging the role and presence of Thiruvappan, as both together represent the dual divine principle that guides the beliefs and rituals in the Muthappan cult.  </p>
          <center> <img src="./IMAGES/muthappan2.jpg" alt=""></center>
            <h1>Muthappan-The Divine Hunter</h1>
            <p>Muthappan is widely revered in Kannur and surrounding districts, especially through the ritual performance of Muthappan Theyyam. He is depicted with a dog companion, ahooked stick, and hunter's attire, symbolizing a divine being who lives among and protects the common folk. He is said to be a deity who defied orthodoxy, embraced inclusivity, and accepted offerings like toddy and dried fish-items traditionally excluded from Brahmanical worship.</p>

            <h1>Thiruvappan- The Majestic Lord</h1>
            <p>Thiruvappan, on the other hand, is regarded as the Vaishnavite aspect of Muthappan, while Vellattam is considered the Shaivite form. When Muthappan is worshipped in full form, both Vellattam and Thiruvappan appear during the Theyyam rituals, symbolizing the unification of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Thiruvappan is considered the regal, divine presence who receives the main offerings and blessings. his appearance is grand often with a heavy crown, peacock feather headdress and intricate face paint. <br>
            In famous Parassinikadavu Muthappan Temple, Thiruvappan is the central deity and daily rituals include offerings and performances dedicated to him. </p>

            <h1>Parassinikadavu Muthappan Temple</h1>
            <p>The most famous shrine dedicated to Muthappan is the Parassinikadavu Muthappan Temple, located on the banks of the Valapattanam River in Kannur district. Unlike typical temples, there are no rigid caste or religious barriers here. People from all walks of life - regardless of caste, religion, or gender - are welcome. This temple is known for its unique rituals, where daily Theyyam performances take place as part of the worship. <br>
            Fish and toddy are the main offerings at the temple, which reflects Muthappan's non-conformist persona. The temple is managed by the local community and functions as a cultural and spiritual center. It also provides free meals to visitors everyday, upholding the values of service and compassion. <br>
        The Parassinikadavu Temple is not just a place of worship but a symbol of Kerala's cultural diversity and social harmony. Thousands of devotees from across the state and even outside visit the temple annually, especially during the annual festival called Muthappan Thiruvoppana Mahotsavam, celebrated with grand rituals and performances.  </p>
        <p>Muthappan is not merely deity but a cultural icon who represents justice, compassion and inclusivity. His worship at Parassinikadavu is a testament to Kerala's deep rooted traditions that embrace all communities. In a world often divided by religion and class, Muthappan continues to be a divine figure of unity, reminding people of the values of love, equality, and service.</p>

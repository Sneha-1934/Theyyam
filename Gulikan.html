        <h1>Gulikan - The Divine Guardian of Death</h1>
        <p>Gulikan Theyyam is one of the most intense and spiritually significant Theyyam performances in the North Malabar region of kerala, particularly in Kannur and Kasargod districts. Known for his terrifying appearance and powerful energy, Gulikan represents Yama, the Hindu god of death. However, in Malabar tradition, Gulikan is not feared; rather, he is respected and revered as a protector and a guide between life and death. </p>
        <p>According to local legends, Gulikan was created by Lord Shiva himself. <br>
        Once Yama, the god of death, was arrogant about his powers over mortal beings. To curb this arrogance and balance the cosmic order, Lord Shiva created a being from his own body - a fearsome spirit called Gulikan. Gulikan's role was to oversee death but with a sense of justice, compassion, and divine authority, unlike Yama's stern approach. <br>
    Shiva sent Gulikan to the earth with the responsibility to supervise deaths and protect those who worship him. It is believed that Gulikan moves between the worlds of the living and the dead, ensuring that the ccycle of life is respected and that death happens at the right time, not through injustice or cruelty</p>

    <p>Vellattam or Vellattu is an invocative ritual held prior to the actual Theyyam performance. The Gulikan Vellattu is held for Gulikan Theyyam, a character which represents the Hindu God of death, Yama. Through Vellattu ritual, the mortal human being is transformed into the divine self. Equivalent to the Thottam (the invocatory chant) ritual, Vellattams are more vibrant and vigorous. <br>
        <center><img src="./IMAGES/gulikan theyyam.jpg" alt=""  width="800px"></center>
        <p>The Gulikan Theyyam ritual, the performer often balances and stands on a tall stick or wooden staff planted firmly in the ground. This is not just a feat of skill, but a powerful spsiritual symbol. This stance is called "Kuliyil ninnu nilkkuka" in local terms "standing on the post." It symbolizes like  agod watching over mortals and their deeds. The stick is usually decorated and positioned at the center of the sacred space. The performer climbs and balances carefully, supported by the assisstants briefly. <br>
        Many devotees believe that witnessing Gulikan standing on the tsick brings protection from unnatural deaths, evil spirits, and misfortune. Elders even recall pedictions or blessingns made by Gulikan from the post that came true.

His presence especially significant during Theyyam seasons, where his performance is seen as cleansing the community of evil forces and ensuring prosperity and health. In place like Kunnathurpadi, Payyannur, and Panoor, gulikan Theyyam is an essential part of the annual temple festivals. </p>
    <p>Gulikan Theyyam reflects a profound cultural undestanding of life, death, and cosmic justice. While death is usually asssociated with fear, Gulikan shows that death is also a divine, just, and necessary. Gulikan reminds us to live a righteous life and to honor the cycle of existence with humility and devotion. Today, Gulikan remains one of the most powerful symbols of spiritual guardianship, blending mythology, ritual, art, and philosophy into a living tradition that continues to inspire and protect the people of Malabar.</p>

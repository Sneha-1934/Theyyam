            <h1> Kadangot Makkam - The Divine Protector</h1>
            <p> Kadangot Makkam is a revered goddess in the folklore ana spiritual traditions  of North kerala. She is celebrated as a symbol of justice, loyalty, and protection, and her story has been passed down through generations as a part of rich Theyyam culture  of the region.</p>
            <p> Makkam was borninto the powerful  Kadangot Nambiar family of Kunhimangalam, near Payyannur in Kannur district. She was the beloved sister of twelve brothers, all of whom loved her deeply. Makkam married a man of her choice from a lower social status. Despite their love for her, her marriage to someone outside her caste brought resentment among some relatives and elders of the family. <br>
            Makkam lived happily with her husband and gave birth to two children - a son and a daughter. However, jealousy and envy festered among some of relatives, particularly sisters-in-law and cousins, plotted against Makkam. They fabricated rumors of her infidelity and accused her of dishonoring the Kadangot family's name. Her brothers, misled by these false accusations, felt that their family's reputation had been destroyed. In those days, family honor was treated as sacred, and even suspicion - not necessarily proof - -was enough to provoke extreme actions.</p>
            <p>Makkam's brothers decided to punish her. Pretending to invite her for a visit,they took Makkam and her two innocent children away under the guise of a pilgrimage or an outing. They led her deep into the forest at a place known as Narekat, near Karivellur.
                She sought refuge at a tharavad in Chala, where an elderly woman offered them milk. Makkam placed a ring in the milk container as a token before continuing their journey. At a well near Kayalode Achankarappalli, Makkam and her children were tragically slain by her brothers, and their bodies were discarded into the well.</p>
                <p> After the gruesome act strange and terrifying  events began happeninig in the Kadangot household. Misfortunes, diseases, and deaths spread like a curse among the family. The people realized that Makkam had been innocent and that a terrible injustice had been committed. <br>
                Makkam and her children's souls werer believed to have transformed into powerful spirits seeking justice. To appease her spirit and prevent further disasters, the villagers are surviving relatives built shrines and began offering prayers to Makkam and her children. She was worshipped as a deity who protects the weak and punishes the wicked - and her two children were worshipped along with her. </p>

                <h1>Makka Pothi</h1>
                <p> Makka Pothi is a term closely connected to the story of Kadangot Makkam in North Kerla's folklore, especially in Theyyam tradition. In the story of Kadangot Makkam, <i>Makkam</i> refers to Makkam herself - the innocent woman who was wrongfully killed by her brothers - and <i>Pothi</i> refers to her children. In Malayalam, "Pothi" means a "small child" or " young one". <br>
                When Makkam and her children's spirit rose with divine power, they were worshipped together. In many Theyyam performances and temple rituals, not only is Kadangot Makkam honored, but her two children - the Makka Pothi - are also worshipped along with her. The bond between the mother and her innocent children is considered sacred and emotional.</p>
                <p>In Theyyam performances, the story of Makkam and her children is vividly enacted, often bringing audiences to tears. The Theyyam dnacer, adorned with fiery colors and powerful makeup, transforms into Makkam, narrating her life, betrayal, and her rise as a goddess who punishes treachery and protects devotees. Temples like the Kadangot Makkam Temple in Karivellur and nearby areas hold annual festivals where Makkam and her children are worshipped with great devotion. Ritual songs sung before the appearance of theyyam, which narrates Makkam's life and death. <br>
                The Makkam Theyyam usually takes place during the Theyyam season ( November to May), and the exact date varies according to the temple calendar </p>
